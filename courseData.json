Please check with your instructor to be sure which system you should access for each course.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is UC moving to Canvas?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Canvas is generally thought to be easier to use for both faculty and students.&nbsp; We hope you'll agree, because we care about your learning experience.&nbsp; Student feedback during the pilot was very positive and was a driving factor in the decision to switch to Canvas.</p>\n<p><strong>Will all my courses be in Canvas?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Probably not at first, but by Summer of 2020, yes, all your courses will be on Canvas.&nbsp; In the meantime, we realize that means that you might have to access both Canvas and Blackboard to get to the material for all your courses.&nbsp; We know that's a pain, but it's just not possible to move the entire university to a new learning management system all at once. We appreciate your patience during the transition.</p>\n<p><strong>What if I have an Incomplete or an ongoing research project during the last semester we have Blackboard? Will I be able to finish my course work?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Yes.&nbsp; Your instructors will be able to move their courses from Blackboard to Canvas so you can finish your course work.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>I belong to an organization that uses a Blackboard course site to communicate and share files.&nbsp; What happens to that?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Those details are still being worked out, but organizations that have a Blackboard course site will be provided a space to continue to share their files and to communicate with each other.&nbsp; Stay tuned for details about that during the 2019-2020 school year.</p>\n<p><strong>Where do I find help if I need it?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">We're really hoping that Canvas is so much easier to use that you won't run into much trouble.&nbsp; But if you do, contact the 24/7 Help Line at&nbsp;<strong>1-(855)-745-4414</strong>.&nbsp; Also, you can access the handy tutorials on using Canvas above on this page.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#toc\">Back to Top</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"Where%20to%20find%20Help\"></a>&nbsp;Where to find help</h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">24/7 Canvas Support:&nbsp; <strong>1-855-745-4414</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">IT@UC&nbsp;Canvas Support:&nbsp; </span><strong><a href=\"https://uc.edu/ithelp\">Service Desk (IT@UC Help Desk)</a></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Canvas Guides:&nbsp; <strong><a href=\"https://community.canvaslms.com/community/answers/guides/\">Search the Canvas Guides</a></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Ask the Community:&nbsp; <strong><a href=\"https://community.canvaslms.com/community/answers\">Get help from a Canvas Expert</a></strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://kb.uc.edu/\">UC Knowledge Base</a></strong></p>",

Please check with your instructor to be sure which system you should access for each course.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is UC moving to Canvas?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Canvas is generally thought to be easier to use for both faculty and students.&nbsp; We hope you'll agree, because we care about your learning experience.&nbsp; Student feedback during the pilot was very positive and was a driving factor in the decision to switch to Canvas.</p>\n<p><strong>Will all my courses be in Canvas?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Probably not at first, but by Summer of 2020, yes, all your courses will be on Canvas.&nbsp; In the meantime, we realize that means that you might have to access both Canvas and Blackboard to get to the material for all your courses.&nbsp; We know that's a pain, but it's just not possible to move the entire university to a new learning management system all at once. We appreciate your patience during the transition.</p>\n<p><strong>What if I have an Incomplete or an ongoing research project during the last semester we have Blackboard? Will I be able to finish my course work?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Yes.&nbsp; Your instructors will be able to move their courses from Blackboard to Canvas so you can finish your course work.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>I belong to an organization that uses a Blackboard course site to communicate and share files.&nbsp; What happens to that?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Those details are still being worked out, but organizations that have a Blackboard course site will be provided a space to continue to share their files and to communicate with each other.&nbsp; Stay tuned for details about that during the 2019-2020 school year.</p>\n<p><strong>Where do I find help if I need it?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">We're really hoping that Canvas is so much easier to use that you won't run into much trouble.&nbsp; But if you do, contact the 24/7 Help Line at&nbsp;<strong>1-(855)-745-4414</strong>.&nbsp; Also, you can access the handy tutorials on using Canvas above on this page.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#toc\">Back to Top</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>\n<a name=\"Where%20to%20find%20Help\"></a>&nbsp;Where to find help</h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">24/7 Canvas Support:&nbsp; <strong>1-855-745-4414</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">IT@UC&nbsp;Canvas Support:&nbsp; </span><strong><a href=\"https://uc.edu/ithelp\">Service Desk (IT@UC Help Desk)</a></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Canvas Guides:&nbsp; <strong><a href=\"https://community.canvaslms.com/community/answers/guides/\">Search the Canvas Guides</a></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Ask the Community:&nbsp; <strong><a href=\"https://community.canvaslms.com/community/answers\">Get help from a Canvas Expert</a></strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://kb.uc.edu/\">UC Knowledge Base</a></strong></p>",

        "<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>Module 1 will span the first two weeks of the course. This module will introduce basic notions of descriptive statistics and probability. &nbsp;We will cover Chapters 1 and 2 of the Devore text.</p>\n<p>We have two distinct goals in this chapter. Our first goal is to describe sets of data. &nbsp;There are many different ways to do this- some methods are pictorial&nbsp;(such as graphs) and other ways are numerical. &nbsp;Common numerical descriptions of data include describing a notion of the \"center\" and a measure of \"dispersion\" around the center. &nbsp;Measures of center include mean, median, and mode. Measures of variance (or dispersion) include variance, standard deviation, and range. &nbsp;We will also set some fundamental terminology such as \"sample\", \"population\", and other terms we will be using.</p>\n<p>Our second goal is to outline the basics of probability theory. &nbsp;Probability is the bedrock on which statistics lies. &nbsp;Often times, probability is a challenging topic because there is a plethora of new terminology and techniques which may be unfamiliar. &nbsp;We will introduce sample spaces and events which module the outcomes of random experiments. Then we will discuss counting techniques in order to introduce the mechanics of computing probability. &nbsp;Finally, we will discuss the important concepts of independent and dependence and apply it to conditional probability.</p>\n<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Define probability</li>\n<li>Define and compute marginal probabilities</li>\n<li>Define and calculate joint probabilities</li>\n<li>Define and compute conditional probabilities</li>\n<li>Categorize &nbsp;events as independent or not independent</li>\n</ul>",

        "<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Please read and take notes over sections 1.1-1.4 in the textbook over Chapter One: Overview and Descriptive Statistics.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you take advantage of the e-textbook in&nbsp;WebAssign&nbsp;(WA), you'll find videos covering content and explaining examples. There may occasionally be notes illuminating particular passages.</p>\n<p>The exercises section will have a variety of problems with which you can hone your skills in these new topics if you want practice outside of the homework assigned in WA.

        "<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>This module will introduce the concept of a random variables. Random variables are the foundation of probability theory and essentially the rest of the course will study random variables and their properties. This week will study sections 3.1-3.3, 4.1-4.2, and 5.1-5.2 of the course text.</p>\n<p>Recall that during Module 1 we introduced the notion of a sample space as the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. A random variables can be succinctly described as a function on the sample space. We call the variable \"random\" because the numerical value that the variable takes depends on the random outcome of the experiment. Here is an example: Suppose our experiment consists of flipping a coin 5 times. Then the sample spaces consists of the 2^5 possible outcomes consisting of a list of 5 H's or T's (like HHHHH, HHHHT, HHHTH ,...). If X =the number of heads in the outcome, then we have defined a function on the sample space and this function takes the values 0, 1,2,3,4, or 5.</p>\n<p>Random variables come in two distinct flavors: discrete and continuous. Discrete random variables are like the previous example- the number of values that the variable takes is only finite or listable. A continuous random variable takes an unlistable, infinite number of values in some interval (a, b). Understanding the distinction between these two classes of variables is an important goal this week. The distinct is crucial because the mathematical treatment of each type is different.</p>\n<p>After we have defined random variables we will associate natural numerical measurements to them called expectation and variance. These will involve some calculus skills when we deal with continuous random variables. We will also introduce the appropriate generalizations if we have two or more random variables.</p>\n<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Define a Random Variable</li>\n<li>Define Discrete and Continuous Probability Distributions</li>\n<li>Define Joint Probability Distributions</li>\n<li>Calculate the Expected Value of a Random Variable</li>\n<li>Compute the Variance and Covariance of a Random Variable</li>\n</ul>",

        "<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>Now that we have basic concepts of random variables (both discrete random variables and continuous random variables), the notion of probability distributions, and the calculations of expected value and variance we will make an in depth study of some of the most common and most important distributions. The following are the distributions that we will study this week:</p>\n<p><strong>Discrete probability distributions:</strong> binomial distribution, hypergeometric distribution, negative binomial distribution, Poisson distribution (Sections 3.4-3.6)</p>\n<p><strong>Continuous probability distributions:</strong> normal distribution, exponential distribution, gamma distribution, chi-squared distribution (Sections 4.3-4.5).</p>\n<p>There are several key take-away that you should aim for this week. Each of these types of distributions have what are called \"parameters\" that describe them (this is the same sense of the word that we learned in Module 01). For example, a normal distribution with mean 10 and standard deviation 5. You should work through the calculations of the expected value and variance for each type of distribution, but note that in each case they can be given simply in terms of the parameters. That means once you have verified the calculation once, you can just use the formulas. A second key take-away should be applications. Investigate when you might want to use the different types of distributions. We must keep in mind math is a tool- we are learning how to use hammers, screw drivers, saws, etc. We don't first learn to use our tools on the final project, though. It is easy to be short sighted and thing that we are just doing math for math's sake, but in reality we need to keep an eye out for physical applications of these ideas.</p>\n<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Define the Binomial, Multinomial and Hypergeometric Distributions</li>\n<li>Define the Negative Binomial and Geometric Distribution</li>\n<li>Examine the Poisson and Uniform Distributions</li>\n<li>Examine the Normal Distribution</li>\n<li>Analyze areas under the normal distribution</li>\n<li>Define the Gamma and Exponential Distribution</li>\n<li>Analyze the Chi-Squared Distribution</li>\n</ul>",
        "<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>In Module 4 we will study statistics, the distributions of statistics, and point estimation. This module covers sections 5.3-5.5 and 6.1-6.2 of course text.</p>\n<p>Recall statistics are numbers that are based on a single sample and as such we may consider something like \"sample mean\" as a random variable it it's own right. As a random variable, it will itself have a distribution. We will introduce some statistics we have mentioned before and then study what they distributions are. In chapter 6 we will introduce point estimation. Recall that one of our goals in inferential statistics is to try to deduce the value of population parameters from samples. Every sample gives us a \"best guess\" or point estimate to these values. These two sections will introduce some general facts about point estimation and methods of point estimation, such as the method of moments.</p>\n<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Describe the idea of Random Sampling</li>\n<li>Compare a Statistic and a Parameter</li>\n<li>Explain the concept of a Sampling distribution</li>\n<li>State the Central Limit Theorem</li>\n<li>Describe the sampling distributions of the sample mean and proportion</li>\n<li>Define the sampling distribution of S^2</li>\n<li>Describe the t and F Distributions</li>\n</ul>",
        "<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>Module 5 is the first of two modules where we study statistical inference. &nbsp;The notion of statistical inference is the estimation of parameters based on a sample while at the same time giving a precise notion of error in our estimates based on the sampling distributions of our statistics. &nbsp;This module will introduce the notion of a <strong>confidence interval.</strong>&nbsp;In a confidence interval we give a range of values for a population parameter. &nbsp;The middle of this interval consists of the point estimate based on our sample. &nbsp;To this point estimate we give width to the confidence interval by adding and subtracting a certain amount of error that depends on the sampling distribution of the statistic. We will introduce prediction intervals and give precise equations for confidence intervals of population mean, variance, and standard deviation. &nbsp;In addition to looking at inference based on one sample we will introduce several examples that involve two samples from different populations.</p>\n<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Define Statistical Inference</li>\n<li>Define a Confidence Interval</li>\n<li>Calculate the estimate of a sample mean from a single sample</li>\n<li>Describe the Standard Error of a Point Estimate</li>\n<li>Describe a Prediction Interval</li>\n<li>Produce an estimate for the difference between the means from two samples</li>\n<li>Compute the estimate of a sample proportion from a single sample</li>\n<li>Produce an estimate for the difference between the sample proportions from two samples</li>\n</ul>",
        "<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>This module covers Sections 8.1-8.5 and Sections 9.3-9.5 of course text. Sections 8.1-8.5 introduce hypothesis tests on a single sample. Section 8.1 is of paramount importance for learning the underlying terms and concepts of statistical hypotheses and the test procedure. Sections 8.2 and 8.3 introduce the one sample Z and T tests for population mean. Then, hypothesis tests for population proportion are introduced. Sections 9.3-9.5 introduce two-sample hypothesis tests. Two sample hypothesis tests allow us to test parameters between two distributions. For example, we can test whether the average salary is the same at two different companies, or, whether average time to failure for a component is the same for two different manufacturing lines.</p>\n<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Define a Statistical Hypothesis</li>\n<li>Define a Statistical Hypothesis Test</li>\n<li>Explain the concept of a p-value for making decisions in hypothesis testing</li>\n<li>Describe and conduct a hypothesis test for a single mean</li>\n<li>Describe and conduct a hypothesis test for the difference between two means</li>\n<li>Illustrate sample size calculations in hypothesis testing</li>\n<li>Identify and conduct a hypothesis test for a single proportion</li>\n<li>Identify and conduct a hypothesis test for the difference between two proportions</li>\n<li>Assess the validity of claims of the values population means and proportions</li>\n</ul>",

        "<p>In Module 2 we will introduce random variables, distributions, and expectations. Random variables should be considered as a function on the sample space of an experiment. Recall that a sample space is the set of all outcomes to an experiment, so a random variable assigns a number to each outcome. We say this variable is \"random\" because the numerical output depends on the outcome of a random experiment. For example, if our experiment was \"select one person from Company A\" then X=salary of person would be a random variable for this experiment. The distribution of a random variable summarizes the values a random variable can take and the probability it takes that value. Finally, expectations generalize the idea of \"average\" to random variables.</p>",
        "<p>In Module 3 we will introduce several different examples of important discrete and continuous random variables. These include the binomial, multinomial, and hypergeometric distributions, the negative binomial and geometric distribution, the Poisson distribution, the normal distribution, the gamma distribution, the exponential distribution, and the chi-squared distribution. All of these distributions have important applications to statistical testing (which we will cover later) or physical applications, many of which appear in engineering.</p>",
        "<p>In Module 4 we will start to connect our developments in probability theorem during modules 2 &amp; 3 with inferential statistics. In general we are going to try to infer parameters of distributions using a finite list of samples. This is a major course theme. A parameter describes a population in it's entirety, but very often we do not know what it is. Moreover, we have no way of calculating it exactly. The best we can do is sample a finite number of observations from the population and estimate. We will talk about random sampling, estimating parameters, the central limit theorem, sampling distributions, and the sampling distributions of some of the parameters that we will be interested in studying!</p>",
        "<p>In Module 5 we will introduce the notion of a confidence interval. A confidence interval gives a range of possible values for a population parameter based on an observed sample. It consists of making a point estimate, which we learned about in this module, and making that the center (or best guess) for our confidence interval. Then we add and subtract an error value that is based on a level of uncertainty and the sampling distribution. We will also introduce to the analogous idea for a two-sample procedure from two different populations where we would like to compare parameters.</p>",
        "<p>Module 6 is the last module of our course! In this module, we will introduce the notion of hypothesis testing. In a hypothesis test we have very specific statistical hypotheses which are claims about population parameters. We then observe a sample. After taking a point estimate the parameter we are testing, we make a specific measure of error between the hypothesized value and the observed estimate. The crux of the hypothesis test is the technique used to quantify how much error is \"unusual\" which leads up to reject our hypothesis and how much error is not unusual in which case we fail to reject our hypothesis. We will develop hypothesis tests for mean and proportion and we will also develop \"two samples\" versions which allow us to compare parameters of different distributions.</p>",
